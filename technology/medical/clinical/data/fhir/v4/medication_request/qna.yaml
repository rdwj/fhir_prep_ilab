  - context: |
      A MedicationRequest is An order or request for both supply of the medication and the instructions for
      administration of the medication to a patient. The resource is called \"MedicationRequest\" rather than
      \"MedicationPrescription\" or \"MedicationOrder\" to generalize the use across inpatient and outpatient
      settings, including care plans, etc., and to harmonize with workflow patterns.
    question: |
      Is a MedicationRequest different from a MedicationPrescription or MedicationOrder?
    answer: |
      A MedicationRequest is distinct from a MedicationPrescription or MedicationOrder in that a MedicationRequest
      has its own key/value pairs and data requirements, and is used across both inpatient and outpatient settings.

    question: What is the resourceType in a MedicationRequest
    answer: |

          medication which may be the details of the medication or simply an attribute carrying a code that identifies
          the medication from a known list of medications.",
          "$ref": "#/definitions/Reference"
        }
      example:
          "medicationReference": {"reference": "#med0310"}

        }

      "reasonCode": {
          "description": "The reason or the indication for ordering or not ordering the medication.",

            "$ref": "#/definitions/CodeableConcept"
          },
          "type": "array"
      example:
        [{"coding": [{"system": "http://snomed.info/sct", "code": "297217002", "display": "Rib Pain (finding)"}]}]
    question: What does the reasonCode need to contain in a MedicationRequest?
    answer: |
      The reasonCode needs to contain the reason or indication for ordering or not ordering the medication.
      This needs to include the system the code is from, for instance, snomed, the code from that system,
      and what to display.
